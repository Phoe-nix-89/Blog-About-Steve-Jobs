Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.</p>

                of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough
                on people. "Look at the results," he replied. "These are all smart
                people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at
                another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they
                don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost
                wistfully, "And we got some amazing things done." Indeed, he
                and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years
                that was greater than that of any other innovative company in
                modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores,
                MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion-not to mention
                every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
                surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had
                been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and
                four children.</div>
